# Scalability

## Load testing and considerations for handling concurrent API requests.
 Gcloud can scale if to many requests are made by duplicating the docker container to give more processing power.

### Separation of Concerns:
Request handling (controllers), data access (models), and business logic are all separated in the code. This makes it simpler to optimize and change areas of the program without having an impact on the system as a whole.

### Service Layer Abstraction:
It abstracts business logic through the use of a service layer. As the program scales, this makes it simpler to include caching, queue processing, and optimizations.

### Asynchronous Operations:
Most of the operations are asynchronous processes. By not obstructing the server's event loop, they enable the server to process numerous requests concurrently.

### Authentication and Access Control:
Effective management of various user roles is facilitated by the use of JWT for authentication and access control via middleware. As the application expands to accommodate more users with varying permissions, this is crucial for load management.
