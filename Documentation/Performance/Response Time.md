# Response times

## Optimisations for response times for CRUD Operation.

 Efficient coding practices followed to keep response times low.

 MongoDB stores data in flexible, schema-less formats, this eliminates the need for complicated queries and enables faster read/write operations.

 The asynchronous nature of CRUD operations (async/await) guarantees that the server does not stall while awaiting a database operation. This improves response times by processing several queries at once.
