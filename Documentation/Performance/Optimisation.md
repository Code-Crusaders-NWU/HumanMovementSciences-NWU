# Optimisation

Large data volumes can be handled more effectively with NoSQL databases (MongoDB) since they do not require the overhead of intricate relational queries.

MongoDB stores data in flexible, schema-less formats, this eliminates the need for complicated queries and enables faster read/write operations.
